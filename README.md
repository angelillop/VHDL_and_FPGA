# VHDL_and_FPGA
Udemy course with FPGA information

* VHDL is not a programming language, we writting a configuration file, writting or describing how do you want a physical 
digital circuit to run on the FPGA.

* VHDLvis not software, it is used to describe the hardware tghat software runs on. So if you have a processor you would write VHDL 
to describe the processor and then you can write software that you can run on that processor.

* When VHDL is synthesized the compiler runs through the code and constructs the gates specified in the VHDL code and implements 
them onto the targeted logic device.
